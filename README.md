## Where python meets fun!!

Python Jupyter notebooks are a very nice way to play with data recipes and visualize data. It provides an low-barrier entry into Python development. See https://jupyter.org/ for more info about the overlying technolgy used.

This repo contains Jupyter notebooks developed to explore Synthetic Aperature Radar (SAR) data hosted at ASF in a friendly way. Specific directories include notebooks for labs used in Franz Meyer's GEOS 657 _Microwave Remote Sensing_ class (https://radar.community.uaf.edu). Other notebooks incode data recipres developed at ASF.
