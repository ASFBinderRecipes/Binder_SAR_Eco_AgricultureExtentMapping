# ASF Jupyter Notebooks
__Where python meets fun!!__

Python Jupyter notebooks are a very nice way to play with data recipes and visualize data. It provides a low-barrier entry into Python development. See https://jupyter.org/ for more info about the overlying technology used.

This repo contains Jupyter notebooks developed to explore Synthetic Aperature Radar (SAR) data hosted at ASF in a friendly way. To see what data is possible to manipulate and analyze, visit https://search.asf.alaska.edu.

Many of the notebooks contained in this repo are built to be ran within certain conda environments (https://github.com/ASFOpenSARlab/opensarlab-envs). Since some required software can not be found within conda, system installations may be needed. The docker files found at https://github.com/ASFOpenSARlab/opensarlab-docker may be used as a guide for system requirements.

Any questions and improvement recommendations can be directed to uaf-jupyterhub-asf+notebooks@alaska.edu.
