# ASF Jupyter Notebooks
__Where python meets fun!!__

Python Jupyter notebooks are a very nice way to play with data recipes and visualize data. It provides a low-barrier entry into Python development. See https://jupyter.org/ for more info about the overlying technolgy used.

This repo contains Jupyter notebooks developed to explore Synthetic Aperature Radar (SAR) data hosted at ASF in a friendly way.

Specific directories include notebooks for labs used in Franz Meyer's GEOS 657 _Microwave Remote Sensing_ class (https://radar.community.uaf.edu). Other notebooks include data recipes developed at ASF.

To see what data is possible to manipulate and analyze, visit https://vertex.daac.asf.alaska.edu.


Many of the notebooks contained in this repo are built to be ran on notebook servers with specific software needs.
