# ASF Jupyter Notebooks
__Where python meets fun!!__

Python Jupyter notebooks provide an easy way to play with data recipes and visualize data. They also provide a low-barrier entry point into general Python development. See https://jupyter.org/ for more info about the overlying technology used.

This repo contains Jupyter notebooks developed to explore Synthetic Aperature Radar (SAR) data hosted at ASF in a user-friendly way. To explore what data are available to manipulate and analyze, visit https://search.asf.alaska.edu.

Many of the notebooks contained in this repo are built to run within certain conda environments (https://github.com/ASFOpenSARlab/opensarlab-envs). Since some required software cannot be found within conda, system installations may be needed. The docker files found at (https://github.com/ASFOpenSARlab/opensarlab-docker) may be used as a guide for system requirements.

Users must build their conda environments in OpenSARlab, which can easily be done with a provided notebook: (https://github.com/ASFOpenSARlab/opensarlab-envs/blob/main/Create_OSL_Conda_Environments.ipynb).
In OpenSARlab, users can find the above mentioned notebook at the path `/home/jovyan/conda_environments/Create_OSL_Conda_Environments.ipynb`.

Any questions and improvement recommendations can be directed to uaf-jupyterhub-asf+notebooks@alaska.edu.
