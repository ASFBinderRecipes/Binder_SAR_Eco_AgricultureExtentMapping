## NISAR Prototype Notebooks

**This directory is intended for members of the NISAR Science Team only.**

[NISAR](https://nisar.jpl.nasa.gov/) is an up-and-coming SAR mission in partnership with NASA and ISRO.
Members of the NISAR science team are developing high level products able to process the enormous amount of SAR data the mission is expected to produce.
Prototypes of the products are being created and shared using Jupyter Notebooks ran on ASF's Jupyter Hub Platform.
While this repo is open to the public, this directory and it's contents are intended for use only by NISAR Science Team members.
